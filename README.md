## Section 3 - Code 
1. Choice of use case, explanation, and necessary classes/methods to complete it
- Implemented the case where a player has won the game. To complete this use case, I had to implement BoardHandler, LargeBoard, SmallBoard, TurnHandler, and Player classes. It was necessary to implement all methods to achieve this goal. I chose this use case, because the most important part of a complex game like this is to be able to tell if a board has been won or not. I also implemented reset.

2. Choice of methods to implement first for the use case that you will implement for the exam, and why?
- I chose the take winCheck method to implement first as it is all encompassing for both small boards and large boards as both are won in the same way.

3. Note of where to find the integration test
- The integration test is in the PlayerTest.java file and has a not above it describing it as the integration test.


Good Luck!
